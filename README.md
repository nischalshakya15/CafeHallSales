# CafeHallSales

## Requirement Analysis and Design 

<p align="justify">
Here, we are required to design and develop the simple console based Java Application for Alice and Bob who run the small business of Caf√© at Halls Gap in rural Victoria to track the individual payment of the customer. Until now, they have not track the individual payment. They calculate the total sales amount at the end of the day by merely adding the total amount at the end of the day. 
Now they want to add the credit card payment prioritizing the customer who might not have cash on hand. Due to the low profit margins and bank fee for processing of the card systems. Alice and Bob want to offer three different type of card payment facility to the customer with bank fees to keep the business profitable. The below table depicts the card type with bank fee.

| Credit Card | Surcharge |
| :----------- | :----------|
| Master Card | 1.5% |
| Amex Card | 3% |
| Gift Card | 0% |


Due to the Covid-19 there has been an increase in both take-away and delivered orders. The delivery can be made anywhere in Halls Gap with following delivery charges. 


| Order ($) | Delivery Charge ($) |
| :----------- | :----------|
| Under $50 | $10 |
| Under $100 and over $50 | $5 |
| Over $100 | $0 |


In case of cash payment, no additional charge is required. However, if the cash payment is done while delivering the order the delivery charge will be added into the total order amount.
